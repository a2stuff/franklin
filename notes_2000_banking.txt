U1 - entire ROM can be banked into $Axxx/Bxxx (with $C079/$C078 softswitches)
$0000-05FF	(empty)
$0600-06FF	Slot 6 Disk Controller firmware     mapped directly to $C6xx
$0700-07FF	(empty)
$0800-0A34	Disk Controller Expansion ROM       code "works" when run from $C800-CA34
$0A35-0AFF	(empty)
$0B00-0CE6	Unknown, possibly a self-test?      code "works" when run from $CB00-CCE6
$0CE7-0FFF	(empty)
$1000-14D7	Parallel Port functions             code "works" when run from $B000-B4D7
$14D8-1FFF	(empty)

U2 - appears to mimic Apple "CD ROM" including most banking logic except for the "Slot 1" range
$0000-00FF	Slot 1 Parallel Port firmware       mapped to $C1xx, banks U1 into $Bxxx to function
$0100-015B	Unknown code
$015C-02FF	(empty)
$0300-03FF	Slot 3 80-column firmware           mapped to $C3xx
$0400-054F	Unknown code, probably 80â€”col       unknown location, likely $C400-C54F
$0550-07FF	(empty)
$0800-0FFF	Expansion ROM, probably for 80-col  code "works" when run from $C800-CFFF
            (this is the ROM code mapped to $C800-CFFF during "idle" at a BASIC prompt)
$1000-1FFF	BASIC                               mapped directly to $Dxxx

U3 - appears to mimic Apple "EF ROM" - fixed, no banking options
$0000-1FFF	BASIC/Monitor                       mapped directly to $Exxx/Fxxx
